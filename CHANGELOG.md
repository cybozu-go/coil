## [Unreleased]

## [2.11.0] - 2025-06-18

Coil Egress now offers dual-stack support, enabling it to handle both IPv4 and IPv6 traffic within a single Egress. We have also implemented a new iptables rule in Egress pods (which are managed by the Egress resource and function as gateways to external networks) to drop invalid packets. Additionally, Egress-related metrics have been updated:

- New metrics have been added to count invalid packets dropped by this new iptables rule.
- The coil_egress_nftables_masqueraded_packets and coil_egress_nftables_masqueraded_bytes metrics have been updated to include support for IPv6.

This release doesn't have any breaking changes.

### Important Changes

We are excited to introduce the stand-alone egress NAT feature (#299) from this version!
Thank you @p-strusiewiczsurmacki-mobica!

Now you can use stand-alone egress and/or ipam mode by `coild` flags.
By default, both are enabled.

You can configure this settings via coild's flag.
The document is here: [docs/cmd-coild.md](./docs/cmd-coild.md#command-line-flags).

There are no breaking changes in this version.
But there are some points which we should take care of when upgrading.

From this version, `coil-controller` is separated into `coil-ipam-controller` and `coil-egress-controller`.

The following steps show how to upgrade coil v2.9.0.

#### Step1: Generate new manifests

You need to generate new version's manifests.
For example, you can get manifests.

```console
$ cd v2
$ make certs
$ kustomize build --load-restrictor=LoadRestrictionsNone .
```

Due to the controller separation, validating and mutating webhooks have also been changed.
Therefore, when generating new versions of the manifests, you must renew webhooks certificates.

#### Step2: Apply new manifests

Once new manifests are applied, `coil-ipam-controller` and `coil-egress-controller` are deployed.
However, `coil-ipam-controller` stays `Pending` because it uses the same port as `coil-controller`.

The following is an example of the `coil-ipam-controller` stays a pending state.
```console
$ kubectl get pod -n kube-system
NAME                                         READY   STATUS              RESTARTS      AGE
coil-controller-7486bd8778-6jnrv             1/1     Running             0             7m29s
coil-controller-7486bd8778-k6vsq             1/1     Running             1 (76s ago)   7m29s
coil-egress-controller-5f6dccb47b-4g9wv      1/1     Running             0             87s
coil-egress-controller-5f6dccb47b-h4sph      1/1     Running             0             87s
coil-ipam-controller-bcfb666d4-42w52         0/1     Pending             0             87s
coil-ipam-controller-bcfb666d4-n5r6s         0/1     Pending             0             87s
```

#### Step3: Delete coil-controller and old webhooks

The following `coil-controller` related resources are no longer needed, and you must delete these to make coil work well.

- deployment/kube-system/coil-controller
- lease/kube-system/coil-leader
- validatingwebhookconfiguration/coilv2-validating-webhook-configuration
- mutatingwebhookconfiguration/coilv2-mutating-webhook-configuration
- clusterrole/coil-controller
- clusterrolebinding/coil-controller

  - The leader election of controller-runtime may not work as expected during the rolling update of coil if you upgrade to v2.1.0 directly because controller-runtime uses leases as the default resource lock object since v0.12.0. See https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/controller-runtime/pull/1773
