Coil
====

**Coil** is a [CNI][]-based network plugin for Kubernetes.

Coil is designed with respect to the UNIX philosophy.  You can combine
Coil with any routing software and/or any network policy implementation.

Coil allows to define multiple IP address pools.  You can define a pool of
global IPv4 addresses for a small number of pods and another pool of
private IPv4 addresses for the remaining pods.

There are blog articles about Coil: https://blog.kintone.io/archive/category/Coil

## Status

Version 2 is generally available (GA).  It conforms to [CNI spec 1.1.0](https://github.com/containernetworking/cni/blob/spec-v1.1.0/SPEC.md).

## Dependencies

- Kubernetes Version: 1.30, 1.31, 1.32
    - Other versions are likely to work, but not tested.

- (Optional) Routing software
    - Coil has a simple routing software for flat L2 networks.
    - If your network is not flat, use BIRD or similar software to advertise the routes.

## Features

- Address pools

    Coil can have multiple pools of IP addresses for different purposes.
    By setting a special annotation to a namespace, you can specify a pool
    for the pods in that namespace.

- IPv4/IPv6 dual stack

    In addition to IPv4-only and IPv6-only stacks, Coil can define dual stack
    address pools.

- Running with any routing software

    Coil provides a simple router for clusters where all the nodes are in
    a flat L2 network.  This router, called `coil-router`, is optional.

    For more complex networks, Coil exports routing information to an
    unused kernel routing table.  By importing the routes from the table,
    any routing software can advertise them.

- On-demand NAT for egress traffics

    Coil can implement SNAT _on_ Kubernetes.  You can define SNAT routers
    for external networks as many as you want.

    Only selected pods can communicate with external networks via SNAT
    routers.

- Auto MTU configuration

    Coil detects the optimal MTU and configures MTU for container networks.

Refer to [the design document](./docs/design.md) for more information on these features.

## Quick start

Coil can run on [kind][] clusters using Docker.

Prepare a recent Ubuntu and install Docker and Go, then run:

```console
$ cd v2
$ make certs
$ make image

$ cd e2e
$ make start
$ make install-coil
$ ../bin/kubectl apply -f manifests/default_pool.yaml
```

Now you can play with Coil.

## Usage examples

[Project Neco](https://blog.kintone.io/entry/neco) uses Coil with these software:

- [BIRD][] to advertise routes over BGP,
- [MetalLB][] to implement [LoadBalancer] Service, and
- [Calico][] to implement [NetworkPolicy][].

Coil can work with [Cilium][] through its [generic veth chaining](https://docs.cilium.io/en/v1.8/gettingstarted/cni-chaining-generic-veth/) feature.

## Documentation

Installation procedures are described in [docs/setup.md](./docs/setup.md).

The user manual is [docs/usage.md](./docs/usage.md).

[docs](docs/) directory contains other documents about designs and specifications.
