Coil
====

**Coil** is a [CNI][] plugin that automates IP address management (IPAM)
and programs intra-node Pod routing for Kubernetes.

Coil is designed in favor of UNIX philosophy.  It is not tightly integrated
with routing daemons like [BIRD][].  It does not implement
[Kubernetes Network Policies][NetworkPolicy] either.

Instead, users can choose their favorite routing daemons and/or network
policy implementations for use with coil.

**Project Status**: General Availability (GA)

Requirements
------------

* Linux Distribution
  - [CoreOS Container Linux][] stable
  - Other distributions are likely to work, but not tested.
* Kubernetes Version
  - 1.12.x
  - 1.13.x
  - Other versions are likely to work, but not tested.
* [etcd][]: coil requires etcd v3 API, does not support v2.
* Routing Software
  - [Bird][]
  - Other software that can import a kernel routing table and advertise them via BGP, RIP, OSPF.

Features
--------

* IP address management (IPAM)

    Coil dynamically allocates IP addresses to Pods.

    Coil has a mechanism called _address pool_ so that the administrator
    can control to assign special/global IP addresses only to some Pods.

* Address pools

    An address pool is a pool of allocatable IP addresses.  In addition to
    the _default_ pool, users can define arbitrary address pools.

    Pods in a specific Kubernetes namespace take their IP addresses from
    the address pool whose name matches the namespace if such a pool exists.

    This way, only users who can create Pods in the namespace can use
    special/global IP addresses.

* Address block

    Coil divides a large subnet into small fixed size blocks (e.g. `/27`),
    and assign them to nodes.  Nodes then allocate IP addresses to Pods
    from the assigned blocks.

* Intra-node Pod routing

    Coil programs _intra_-node routing for Pods.

    As to inter-node routing, coil publishes address blocks assigned to
    the node to an unused kernel routing table as described next.

* Publish address blocks to implement inter-node Pod routing

    Coil registers address blocks assigned to a node with an unused
    kernel routing table.  The default table ID is `119`.

    The routing table can be referenced by other routing programs
    such as [BIRD][] to implement inter-node routing.

    An example BIRD configuration file that advertises address blocks
    via BGP is available at [mtest/bird.conf](mtest/bird.conf).

Programs
--------

This repository contains these programs:

* `coil`: [CNI][] plugin.
* `coilctl`: CLI tool to configure coil IPAM.
* `coild`: A background service to manage IP address.
* `coil-controller`: watches kubernetes resources for coil.
* `coil-installer`: installs `coil` and CNI configuration file.
* `hypercoil`: all-in-one binary just like `hyperkube`.

`coil` should be installed in `/opt/cni/bin` directory.

`coilctl` directly communicates with etcd.
Therefore it can be installed any host that can connect to etcd cluster.

`coild` and `coil-installer` should run as [`DaemonSet`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/daemonset/).

`coil-controller` should be deployed as [`Deployment`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/).

Documentation
-------------

[docs](docs/) directory contains documents about designs and specifications.
